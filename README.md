# What is Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe it's a game where two players place "x"s or "o"s in a grid with nine spaces. The winner is the first player who places three "x"s or three "o"s in a straight line.


# Game Rules

1. The game is played on a grid with nine spaces.

2. Enter the name of the players (if no name entered it will ask you to enter again)

2. Player 1 is "x", Player 2 is "o". 

3. You can place your move in the table by selecting a space between 1 & 3 for rows and columns (if it's different you will be asked to place it again)

4. If the place its already toked, it will ask you to select a new space

4. The first player to get 3 of "x" or "o" in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner of the round.

5. If no player has three marks, the game ends in "Draw!" 

5. When all nine squares are full or there is a winner, the game is over, and you will be asked if you "Want to play another round?"
